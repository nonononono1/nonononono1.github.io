      <p> Welcome to the area where I can talk and complain about stuff. Is this a diary, is this for venting, who knows?</p>
      <h2> Reading into a theory </h2>
      <p> Recently, I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Gay_uncle_hypothesis"> a theory on why being gay somehow survived the cruelty of evolution. </a><br> To be honest, I still don't understand how the theory works, but it is interesting to read anyway, and it's comforting/reassuring to know. </p>
